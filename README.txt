Installation instructions:
This google drive folder contains the source code and datasets that are necessary to run the project.

This project was developed in the Anaconda envirnment that is suggested to avoid any package conflicts
generated by different package managers other than Conda.

Download the entire folder and open the main.ipynb notebook. You will find all the necessary libraries
to install in the first cell of the notebook. It might be necessary to install other minor supporting 
libraries as it will be said by warning/error messages.

Run the entire notebook. The S-bert encoding is extremely time-consuming, thus you can directly use
its output dataset in the folowwing chapters. In fact, the dataset folder contains all the 
datasets produced by the notebbok. Pay attention to the definition of variables that might be used 
amongst different chapters.
