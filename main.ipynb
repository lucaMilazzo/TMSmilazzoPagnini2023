      "tissue changes around loose prostheses a canine model to investigate the effects of an antiinflammatory agent the aseptically loosened prosthesis provided a means for investigating the in vivo and in vitro activity of the cells associated with the loosening process in seven dogs the cells were isolated and maintained in culture for sufficient periods of time so that their biologic activity could be studied as well as the effect of different agents added to the cells in vivo or in vitro the biologic response as determined by interleukin1 and prostaglandin e2 activity paralleled the roentgenographic appearance of loosening and the technetium images and observations made at the time of revision surgery the correlation between clinical roentgenographic histologic and biochemical loosening indicates that the canine model is suitable for investigating the mechanisms of prosthetic failure a canine model permits the study of possible nonsurgical therapeutic interventions with the ultimate hope of stopping or slowing the loosening process \n",

      "preliminary studies for an immunotherapeutic approach to the treatment of human myeloma using chimeric anticd38 antibody multiple myeloma is a disease in which conventional chemotherapy has only limited value but which may be ideal for treatment with passive antibody against a suitable cell surface antigen on the neoplastic plasma cell the cd38 antigen is known to be present on the majority of neoplastic plasma cells and this was confirmed by detailed examination of bone marrow aspirates from three patients strong expression of cd38 was confined to cells which by the criteria of lightscattering profiles and possession of cytoplasmic ig were plasma cells the vast majority of neoplastic plasma cells appeared to be involved using a cell line as a model it was found that the cd38 antigen acts as a target for a chimeric antibody prepared from the antibody okt10 the chimeric antibody consists of the fab portion of the mouse monoclonal antibody linked by a stable thioether bond to an fc molecule derived from human igg1 thereby forming mouse fabhuman fc in contrast to the parent antibody the chimeric molecule mediates antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity adcc very efficiently with human blood mononuclear effector cells and is effective at low concentration also even though the cd38 antigen is present on natural killer cells there appears to be little deleterious action of the antibody on effector cell function the antibody also failed to affect the growth of progenitor cells of the granulocytemacrophage or erythroid lineages present in normal bone marrows despite the suspicion that these cells express the antigen other advantages of the cd38 molecule are that it is not found in the serum of patients with myeloma and it does not appear to modulate in vitro fourteen patients with florid myeloma and on various chemotherapeutic regimes had an undiminished capacity to mediate adcc with the chimeric antibody when compared with normal individuals the maintenance of adcc activity coupled with the known suppression of the antibody response in these patients augers well for treatment with chimeric antibody \n",
